# plant-disease-detection
The Plant Disease Detection Project uses Machine Learning and image processing to detect diseases in plant leaves. A CNN model is trained on a dataset of leaf images to classify healthy and diseased plants. This helps in early detection, reducing crop loss, and supporting smart, sustainable agriculture.
